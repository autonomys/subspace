/// `Behaviour` controls and maintains the state of connections to a predefined set of peers.
///
/// The `Behaviour` struct is part of our custom protocol that aims to maintain persistent
/// connections to a predefined set of peers. It encapsulates the logic of managing the connections,
/// dialing, and handling various states of these connections.
///
/// ## How it works
///
/// Each `ReservedPeerState` can be in one of the following states, represented by the
/// `ConnectionStatus` enum:
/// 1. `NotConnected`: This state indicates that the peer is currently not connected.
///    The time for the next connection attempt is scheduled and can be queried.
/// 2. `PendingConnection`: This state means that a connection attempt to the peer is currently
///    in progress.
/// 3. `Connected`: This state signals that the peer is currently connected.
///
/// The protocol will attempt to establish a connection to a `NotConnected` peer after a set delay,
/// specified by configurable dialing interval, to prevent multiple simultaneous connection attempts
/// to offline peers. This delay not only conserves resources, but also reduces the amount of
/// log output.
///
/// ## Comments
///
/// The protocol will establish one or two connections between each pair of reserved peers.
///
/// IMPORTANT NOTE: For the maintenance of a persistent connection, both peers should have each
/// other in their `reserved peers set`. This is necessary because if only one peer has the other
/// in its `reserved peers set`, regular connection attempts will occur, but these connections will
/// be dismissed on the other side due to the `KeepAlive` policy.
///
