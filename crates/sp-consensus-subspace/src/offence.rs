//! Common traits and types that are useful for describing offences for usage in environments
//! that use subspace consensus.
//!
//! ## Comparison with [sp_staking::offence]
//!
//! Unlike [sp_staking::offence] handles both the offline and equivocation offences, there is only
//! equivocation attack in subspace as it's a permissionless consensus based on PoC holding to
//! Nakamoto's vision and does not have a known validator set for the block production.
