/// # Feed Processor
/// Feed Processor defines some useful abstractions that are used during the life cycle of the Feed and its objects.
/// We can provide some custom logic specific to the Feed by implementing a Custom Feed Processor.
///
/// ## Feed Metadata
///
/// Before an object is added to Subspace storage, `put` on Feed processor to give the impl an opportunity to run the object
/// through their custom logic and returns some metadata about the object. Metadata is then stored in the runtime overwriting
/// any metadata of the previous object. The default implementation of Feed processor gives empty metadata about the object.
///
/// ## Feed object mapping
/// Feed indexes the objects in the DSN using offsets within the Block the object is present in. `object_mappings` is the
/// only that must be implemented by the Feed processor. Since DSN is a key value store, there are two different ways keys
/// are derived for given data at the offset within the block
/// - Key derived from content. Feeds use BLAKE2b-256 to derive the key for the data at the offset.
/// - Key provided by the feed processor. Feed processor implementations can instead provide a key for object at the offset.
///
/// ## Examples
/// ### Content based addressing with default hasher
/// ```rust
/// use pallet_feeds::feed_processor::{FeedProcessor, FeedObjectMapping};
/// struct IPFSLike;
/// impl<FeedId> FeedProcessor<FeedId> for IPFSLike { ///
///     fn object_mappings(&self, _feed_id: FeedId, _object: &[u8]) -> Vec<FeedObjectMapping> {
///         vec![FeedObjectMapping::Content { offset: 0 }]
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// This implements a Content addressable Feed using default Hasher. The entire object is treated as data and hence the offset is zero.
///
/// ### Content based addressing using custom Hasher
/// ```rust
/// use sp_runtime::traits::{BlakeTwo256, Hash};
/// use pallet_feeds::feed_processor::{FeedProcessor, FeedObjectMapping};
/// struct IPFSLike;
/// impl<FeedId> FeedProcessor<FeedId> for IPFSLike { ///
///     fn object_mappings(&self, _feed_id: FeedId, object: &[u8]) -> Vec<FeedObjectMapping> {
///         vec![FeedObjectMapping::Custom { key: BlakeTwo256::hash(object).as_bytes().to_vec(), offset: 0 }]
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// This implements a Content addressable Feed using BlakeTwo256 hasher. The entire object is treated as data and hence the offset is zero.
