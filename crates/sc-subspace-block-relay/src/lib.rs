//! Block relay implementation.
//!
//! The components in the system:
//! 1. Relay users like consensus, execution. They implement the use case
//!    specific logic that drives the relay protocol. This has a client
//!    side stub, and a server side task to process incoming requests.
//! 2. Relay protocol that is agnostic to the relay user. The protocol
//!    is abstracted to be reused for different use cases. The protocol
//!    also has corresponding client/server side components.
//! 3. Protocol backend: relay user specific abstraction used by the relay
//!    protocol to populate the protocol messages
//!
//! Nodes advertise/exchange DownloadUnits with each other. DownloadUnit has
//! two parts:
//! - ProtocolUnits: the part fetched by the relay protocol. This is bulk of
//!   the data transfer that we would like to optimize
//! - Rest of the download unit, handled directly by the relay user
//!
//! Examples:
//! 1. Consensus
//!    DownloadUnit = Block, ProtocolUnit = extrinsics
//!    The extrinsics are handled by the protocol, remaining block
//!    fields are directly filled by the caller. The protocol backend
//!    helps fetch blocks/transactions from the substrate backend
//! 2. Execution
//!    TODO
//! 3. Other possible use cases (e.g) reconcile/sync the transaction pool
//!    between two nodes. In this case, DownloadUnit = transaction pool,
//!    ProtocolUnit = transaction
//!
//! The download has two phases:
//! -  Initial request/response
//!    Ideally, download of all the protocol units in the download unit should
//!    be completed during this phase
//! -  Reconcile phase
//!    If the initial phase could not complete the download, additional
//!    request/response messages are initiated by the protocol to fetch the
//!    protocol units
//!
