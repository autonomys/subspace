//! Consensus archiver responsible for archival of blockchain history, it is driven by block import
//! pipeline.
//!
//! Implements archiving process in Subspace blockchain that converts blockchain history (blocks)
//! into archived history (pieces).
//!
//! The main entry point here is [`create_subspace_archiver`] that will create a task, which while
//! driven will perform the archiving itself.
//!
//! Archiving is triggered by block importing notification ([`SubspaceLink::block_importing_notification_stream`])
//! and tries to archive the block at [`ChainConstants::confirmation_depth_k`](sp_consensus_subspace::ChainConstants::confirmation_depth_k)
//! depth from the block being imported. Block import will then wait for archiver to acknowledge
//! processing, which is necessary for ensuring that when the next block is imported, inherents will
//! contain segment header of newly archived block (must happen exactly in the next block).
//!
//! Archiving itself will also wait for acknowledgement by various subscribers before proceeding,
//! which includes farmer subscription, in case of reference implementation via RPC
//! (`sc-consensus-subspace-rpc`), but could also be in other ways.
//!
//! [`SegmentHeadersStore`] is maintained as a data structure containing all known (including future
//! in case of syncing) segment headers. This data structure contents is then made available to
//! other parts of the protocol that need to know what correct archival history of the blockchain
//! looks like. For example, it is used during node sync and farmer plotting in order to verify
//! pieces of archival history received from other network participants.
//!
//! [`recreate_genesis_segment`] is a bit of a hack and is useful for deriving of the genesis
//! segment that is special case since we don't have enough data in the blockchain history itself
//! during genesis in order to do the archiving.
//!
//! [`encode_block`] and [`decode_block`] are symmetric encoding/decoding functions turning
//! [`SignedBlock`]s into bytes and back.
