# Subspace Proof-of-Storage Consensus

Subspace is a slot-based block production mechanism which uses a Proof-of-Storage to randomly
perform the slot allocation. On every slot, all the farmers evaluate their disk-based plot. If
they have a tag (reflecting a commitment to a valid encoding) that it is lower than a given
threshold (which is proportional to the total space pledged by the network) they may produce a
new block. The proof of the Subspace function execution will be used by other peers to validate
the legitimacy of the slot claim.

The engine is also responsible for collecting entropy on-chain which will be used to seed the
given PoR (Proof-of-Replication) challenge. An epoch is a contiguous number of slots under which
we will be using the same base PoR challenge. During an epoch all PoR outputs produced as a
result of block production will be collected into an on-chain randomness pool. Epoch changes are
announced one epoch in advance, i.e. when ending epoch N, we announce the parameters (i.e, new
randomness) for epoch N+2.

Since the slot assignment is randomized, it is possible that a slot is claimed by multiple
farmers, in which case we will have a temporary fork, or that a slot is not claimed by any
farmer, in which case no block is produced. This means that block times are probabilistic.

The protocol has a parameter `c` [0, 1] for which `1 - c` is the probability of a slot being
empty. The choice of this parameter affects the security of the protocol relating to maximum
tolerable network delays.

The fork choice rule is weight-based, where weight equals the number of primary blocks in the
chain. We will pick the heaviest chain (more blocks) and will go with the longest one in case of
a tie.

This module is based on a fork of `sc_consensus_babe`.  An in-depth description and analysis of the BABE protocol, can be found here:
