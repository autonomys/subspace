# To Farm By Yourself (Offline)

1. Download the executables for your operating system
2. Open your favourite terminal, and go to the folder where you download the executables

**Linux/MacOS:**
1. Make them executable: `chmod +x subspace-farmer-x86_64-*-snapshot subspace-node-x86_64-*-snapshot`
2. Run the node: `./subspace-node-x86_64-*-snapshot --dev --tmp`
3. In macOS, it may prompt that this app is not verified. Click on `cancel` instead of moving it to trash.
   To allow execution, go to `System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General`, and click on `allow`.
   After this, simply repeat step 4. This time, there will be `Open` button in the prompt, click it to run node.
4. Run the farmer (do this in another terminal): `./subspace-farmer-x86_64-*-snapshot farm`
5. In macOS, it may prompt that this app is not verified. Click on `cancel` instead of moving it to trash.
   To allow execution, go to `System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General`, and click on `allow`.
   After this, simply repeat step 4. This time, there will be `Open` button in the prompt, click it to run node.

**Windows**
1. Run the node: `subspace-node-x86_64-*-snapshot --dev --tmp`
2. After running this command, Windows may ask you for permissions related to firewall, select `allow` in this case.
3. Run the farmer (do this in another terminal): `subspace-farmer-x86_64-*-snapshot farm`

## to Build From The Source (primarily for developers)

This is a monorepo with multiple binaries and the workflow is typical for Rust projects:

- `cargo run --release --bin subspace-node --dev --tmp` to run [a node](/crates/subspace-node)
- `cargo run --release --bin subspace-farmer farm` to [start farming](/crates/subspace-farmer)

NOTE 1: You need to have `nightly` version of Rust toolchain with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target available or else you'll get a compilation error.
NOTE 2: Following the commands above, you will be farming in an offline setting (by yourself).
NOTE 3: To farm in online setting, you can modify the command accordingly.

You can find readme files in corresponding crates for requirements, multi-node setup and other details.
