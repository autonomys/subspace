# üë®‚Äçüåæ Getting Started Farming

This is the documentation/guideline on how to run the farmer. You may also refer to the [help](#help) section for various commands.

We are regularly releasing stable snapshots. Our CI builds container images and executables for 3 major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

Our snapshots are categorized as the following:
- **Stable releases (you should always grab the latest one, these are the ones that are tested by our team)**
- Pre-releases (for testing things early, intended for developers)

You need 2 executables, select whichever applies to your operating system
* Node Executable - `subspace-node-...`
* Farmer Executable - `subspace-farmer-...`

You can find these executables in the [Releases](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/releases) section of this Repository.

> This is a ***non-incentivized*** testnet. Meaning there are no rewards in place at this time, and has absolutely no financial benefit to being run at this time.

## Polkadot.js wallet

Before running anything you need to have a wallet where you'll receive testnet coins.
Install [Polkadot.js extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) into your browser and create a new account there.
The address of your account will be necessary at the last step.

## üñºÔ∏è Windows Instructions

1. Download the executables for your operating system from the [Releases](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/releases) tab.
2. Open `Powershell` (we do not recommend using Command Prompt as it's syntax is slightly different)
3. In the terminal we will change to the Downloads directory using this command `cd Downloads`
4. We will then start the node using the following command

```PowerShell
# Replace `NODE_FILE_NAME.exe` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
# Replace `INSERT_YOUR_ID` with a nickname you choose
# Copy all of the lines below, they are all part of the same command
.\NODE_FILE_NAME.exe `
--chain testnet `
--wasm-execution compiled `
--execution wasm `
--bootnodes "/dns/farm-rpc.subspace.network/tcp/30333/p2p/12D3KooWPjMZuSYj35ehced2MTJFf95upwpHKgKUrFRfHwohzJXr" `
--rpc-cors all `
--rpc-methods unsafe `
--ws-external `
--validator `
--telemetry-url "wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 1" `
--telemetry-url "wss://telemetry.subspace.network/submit 1" `
--name INSERT_YOUR_ID
```

# ü§îNotes

## Checking results and interacting with farmnet

Visit [Polkadot.js explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ffarm-rpc.subspace.network#/explorer), from there you can interact with the Subspace Farmnet as any Substrate-based blockchain.

## Invalid Solution
If you are getting `invalid solution` errors (visible on the terminal that Node runs), please follow "Switching to a new snapshot" steps below and start afresh.

---
## Switching to a new snapshot
If you were running a node previously, and want to switch to a new snapshot, please perform these steps and then follow the guideline again:
```
# Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe
# Replace `NODE_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./NODE_FILE_NAME purge-chain --chain testnet
```
Does not matter if the node/farmer executable is the previous one or from the new snapshot, both will work :)
The reason we require this is, with every snapshot change, the network might get partitioned, and you may be on a different genesis than the current one.
In plain English, these commands are like a `reset` button for snapshot changes.

## Help

There are extra commands and parameters you can use on farmer or node, use the `--help` after any other command to display additional options.

Below are some helpful farmer commands:

- `farm --reward-address WALLET_ADDRESS` : starts background plotting and farming together, farmed testnet coins will be sent to `WALLET_ADDRESS`
- `farm` : starts background plotting and farming together, rewards are sent to auto-generated wallet (see `identity` commands below)
- `wipe` : erases the plot and identity (including plot, commitment, object mappings and identity files)
- `identity import-from-mnemonic "spell out your seed phrase here"` : imports your existing identity from your seed phrase (not recommended! use `--reward-address` instead)
- `identity view` : displays SS58 address (this is the same as `identity view --address`) where farmed testnet coins will be sent
- `identity view --mnemonic` : displays mnemonic phrase of auto-generated wallet (sensitive information, keep this private, not very useful if `--reward-address` was used)

Examples:
```bash
# Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./FARMER_FILE_NAME farm --help
./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe
```
