# üë®‚Äçüåæ Getting Started Farming

This is the documentation/guideline on how to run the farmer. You may also refer to the [help](#help) section for various commands.

We are regularly releasing stable snapshots. Our CI builds container images and executables for 3 major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

Our snapshots are categorized as the following:
- **Stable releases (you should always grab the latest one, these are the ones that are tested by our team)**
- Pre-releases (for testing things early, intended for developers)

You need 2 executables, select whichever applies to your operating system
* Node Executable - `subspace-node-...`
* Farmer Executable - `subspace-farmer-...`

You can find these executables in the [Releases](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/releases) section of this Repository.

## Polkadot.js wallet

Before running anything you need to have a wallet where you'll receive testnet coins.
Install [Polkadot.js extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) into your browser and create a new account there.
The address of your account will be necessary at the last step.

## Required ports
Currently, TCP and UDP ports `30333`, `30433` and `30533` need to be exposed for node and farmer to work properly.

If you have a server with no firewall, there is nothing to be done, but otherwise make sure to open TCP and UDP ports `30333`, `30433` and `30533` for incoming connections.

On the desktop side if you have a router in front of your computer, you'll need to forward TCP and UDP ports `30333`, `30433` and `30533` to the machine on which your node is running (how this is done varied from router to router, but there is always a feature like this, ask [on the forum](https://forum.subspace.network/) if you have questions).
If you're connected directly without any router, then again nothing needs to be done in such case.

## üñºÔ∏è Windows Instructions

1. Download the executables for your operating system from the [Releases](https://github.com/subspace/subspace/releases) tab.
2. Open `Powershell` (we do not recommend using Command Prompt as its syntax is slightly different)
3. In the terminal we will change to the Downloads directory using this command `cd Downloads`
4. We will then start the node using the following command

```PowerShell
# Replace `NODE_FILE_NAME.exe` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
# Replace `INSERT_YOUR_ID` with a nickname you choose
# Copy all of the lines below, they are all part of the same command
.\NODE_FILE_NAME.exe `
--chain gemini-3f `
--execution wasm `
--blocks-pruning 256 `
--state-pruning archive `
--no-private-ipv4 `
--validator `
--name "INSERT_YOUR_ID"
```
5. You should see something similar in the terminal:

```

After which follow these steps:
* Now edit created file:
  * Replace `snapshot-DATE` with the latest release (not pre-release!) snapshot (like `snapshot-2022-apr-29`)
  * Replace `INSERT_YOUR_ID` with desired name that will be shown in telemetry (doesn't impact anything else)
  * Replace `WALLET_ADDRESS` with your wallet address
  * Replace `PLOT_SIZE` with plot size in gigabytes or terabytes, for example 100G or 2T (but leave at least 10G of disk space for node)
  * If you want to store files on a separate disk or customize port, read comments in the file
* Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed and running
* Now go to directory with `docker-compose.yml` and type `docker-compose up -d` to start everything

You can read logs with `docker-compose logs --tail=1000 -f`, for the rest read [Docker Compose CLI reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/).

# ü§îNotes

## Checking results and interacting with the network

Visit [Polkadot.js explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Feu-0.gemini-3f.subspace.network%2Fws#/explorer), from there you can interact with Subspace Network as any Substrate-based blockchain.

## Switching from older/different versions of Subspace

### CLI

If you were running a node previously, and want to switch to a new snapshot, please perform these steps and then follow the guideline again:
```
# Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe PATH_TO_FARM
# Replace `NODE_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./NODE_FILE_NAME purge-chain --chain gemini-3f
```
Does not matter if the node/farmer executable is the previous one or from the new snapshot, both will work :)
The reason we require this is, with every snapshot change, the network might get partitioned, and you may be on a different genesis than the current one.
In plain English, these commands are like a `reset` button for snapshot changes.

Now follow installation guide.

### Docker

In case of Docker setup run `docker-compose down -v` (and manually delete custom directories if you have specified them).

Now follow installation guide.

## Help

There are extra commands and parameters you can use on farmer or node, use the `--help` after any other command to display additional options.

Below are some helpful samples:

- `./FARMER_FILE_NAME benchmark audit PATH_TO_FARM`: benchmark auditing performance of the farm at `PATH_TO_FARM`
- `./FARMER_FILE_NAME info PATH_TO_FARM`: show information about the farm at `PATH_TO_FARM`
- `./FARMER_FILE_NAME scrub PATH_TO_FARM`: Scrub the farm to find and fix farm at `PATH_TO_FARM` corruption
- `./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe PATH_TO_FARM`: erases everything related to farmer if data were stored in `PATH_TO_FARM`
- `./NODE_FILE_NAME --base-path NODE_DATA_PATH --chain gemini-3f ...`: start node and store data in `NODE_DATA_PATH` instead of default location
- `./NODE_FILE_NAME purge-chain --base-path NODE_DATA_PATH --chain gemini-3f`: erases data related to the node if data were stored in `NODE_DATA_PATH`

Examples:
```bash
# Replace `FARMER_FILE_NAME` with the name of the node file you downloaded from releases
./FARMER_FILE_NAME farm --help
./FARMER_FILE_NAME wipe PATH_TO_FARM
```

## [Advanced] Support for multiple disks

Farm path and size you have seen above can be specified more than once to engage multiple disks.
It is recommended to specify multiple disks explicitly rather than using RAID for better hardware utilization and efficiency.

Example:
```
./FARMER_FILE_NAME farm --reward-address WALLET_ADDRESS \
    path=/media/ssd1,size=100GiB \
    path=/media/ssd2,size=10T \
    path=/media/ssd3,size=10T
```

## [Advanced] Build from source (Linux)

If you're running unsupported Linux distribution or CPU architecture, you may try to build binaries yourself from source.

NOTE: This is primarily targeted at tech-savvy users and not recommended unless you know what you're doing.
Please try to find answer to your question online before reaching out to maintainers.

You'll have to have [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) installed as well as LLVM, Clang and CMake in addition to usual developer tooling (Ubuntu example):
```bash
sudo apt-get install llvm clang cmake
```

Now clone the source and build snapshot `snapshot-2022-apr-29` (replace occurrences with the snapshot you want to build):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/subspace/subspace.git
cd subspace
git checkout snapshot-2022-apr-29
cargo build \
    --profile production \
    --bin subspace-node \
    --bin subspace-farmer
```

You'll find two binaries under `target/production` directory once it succeeds, after which refer to instructions above on how to use them.
